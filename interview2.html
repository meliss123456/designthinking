</br>3. How is the atmosphere in school? Do you feel that school is especially hard for a good atmosphere?</br>

</br>4. Is there a good relationship between seniors and juniors? If it's good, what seems to form that atmosphere? </br>

<h3>[Ewha Womans University Student 2]  </h3></br></br>
<p>1. As a student attending Ewha, do you feel satisfied with your membership? </br>
- I feel very satisfied. </br>
</br>2. If you answered the above question positively, where do you feel you belong?</br>
- It is the oldest and most traditional school in history among women's university institutions.</br> When I look at the history of alumni, I feel strongly belonging to the alumni because they help each other. </br>I think it is very familiar that they reach out to each other because they are students of Ewha rather than just women. </br>
</br>3. How is the atmosphere in school? Do you feel that school is especially hard for a good atmosphere? </br>
- As I said earlier, the atmosphere of wanting to develop the alumni culture and continue to help each other out, </br>and the best thing is that it's the best environment to study. You can study in-depth in the field of your choice with less interference from other factors. </br>
</br>4. Is there a good relationship between seniors and juniors? If it's good, what seems to form that atmosphere? </br>
- The network between seniors and juniors (sustained meeting opportunities, presentations, Kakao Talk rooms, etc.)</br> is really good, so it seems like we have to get along well with seniors. </br>
</br>5. Lastly, what is the pride of Ewha Womans University as a student attending Ewha Womans University? </br>
- Ehwa seems to want to fight injustice and hold firm justice more than any other school. </br>So it was the beginning of many changes against injustice and a remarkable change in the history of Korea.</br> So I think that this is the pride of the opposite sex compared to other schools in the spirit of trying to get ahead without fear of change. </br>

<h3>[Ewha Womans University Student 3]</h3></br></br>
<p>1.The moment you feel proud of your school? Differentiate from other schools?</br>
- Campus, buildings are pretty and there are many restaurants around. </br>As there were many accidents (Jeong Yu-ra) at schools, demonstrations and campaigns that take place as the main body of students are active. It seems that unity is increasing in the process of solving problems among students and uncovering the truth.</br>
- Students also collected their own money in the form of sponsorship and handed out macaron to essay test takers.</br>
</br>2. Why is the combination going well?</br>
- The student-led trend seems to have been solidified to some extent. a tendency to stick together I don't know. I don't think there are any characteristics of women.</br>
</br>3.Why do people come to see this time?</br>
- I think it's because of the campus tour, the tourist attraction.</br>
</br>4. What are the disadvantages?</br>
- External access to the classroom or interior of the building. It's noisy. </br>
</br>5. What about the Ewha community?</br>
- Ihwaian. Similar to the Gofas site of Korea University. A secret site different from Etta, which is easily accessible to students from other schools.</br> If you make a fuss, you can talk about the difficult parts comfortably. Itâ€™s very active. There are, of course, daily stories, genealogy sharing, etc. </br>
</br>6. The last time I used it, there's a level in this community.</br>
-You have the authority to access writings by level. In order to see a high level of writing, you have to raise your rating. Post comments/write comments. What's unique is the way in which high-level writing is set. The higher the number of readings and empathy, not the type of writing or the writer, the higher the level of writing. It seems to induce a lot of participation.</br>
</br>7. Did you notice anything different from using the community?</br>
-It's not long since it's actually been used and not by all of these college students. I don't feel much from my skin, but I feel more like I'm in a community.</br>
